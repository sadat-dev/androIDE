# androIDE
## An Intuitive IDE for android devices

### Preface
Have you ever thought, what if I could code while on the go?
Suddenly got that brilliant game changing idea only to forget
that by the time you get to a pc to start coding? Well this IDE
is primarily intended to people like you then. The concept for 
this IDE came mainly from the Unreal Engine's Blueprint editor
so I must thank EPIC for coming up with that brilliant idea, but 
it is not intended towards mobile devices. This is why I decided
to originate this project.

### Possibilities
This can possibly be used in educational institutes for starting students
and can be used as a presentation tool to present one's code, as well as a
handly little thing to figure out those pesky undocumented codes ;) .

### Targets
This IDE should provide a very intuitive interface to create graphical
code which can be parsed to as many coding languages as possible, I am mainly
thinking of (Java, C#, C++ and Objective-C). I am sure about Java and C#,
the rest I leave to knowledgeable members of the community to figure out and
enlighten us.

Source code files should be parsed to the graphical code context if loaded into
the IDE and should have full support for eclipse projects for Java atleast. 

Embedded compilers for compiling code in the device and finally, to add icing on top of
the cake, should preferably run without root access to make it available to general users.

### Open-Source Libraries Used
* Eclipse JDT Core
